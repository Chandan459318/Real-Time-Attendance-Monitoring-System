# Real-Time Attendance Monitoring System 📸📝  

## 📍 Project Overview  
This project is a **Real-time attendance Monitoring system** that uses **Face Recognition** for **automated student authentication**. It replaces **manual attendance** with a secure, efficient, and accurate solution.  

### 🔹 **Key Features**
✅ **Face Recognition-Based Attendance** – Uses **OpenCV’s LBPH Face Recognizer** to identify students and mark attendance automatically.  
✅ **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** – Built with **Tkinter** for easy student registration, training, and attendance monitoring.  
✅ **Real-Time Attendance Logging** – Captures attendance in a **CSV file**, making it easy for administrators to track records.  
✅ **Multi-Threading for Performance Optimization** – Ensures a fast and responsive system while processing face detection & recognition.  
✅ **Data Storage & Management** – Stores attendance logs efficiently in CSV format.
